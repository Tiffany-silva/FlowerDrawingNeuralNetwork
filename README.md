# Flower Drawing Classification Neural Network
Forming an image of a flower using red and blue dots classified using a neural network

The Neural network is a 2-class classification consisting of one hidden layer.

Required Packages for implementation are as follows,
Numpy: Used for scientific computation with Python
sklearn: Used for data analysis and data mining
matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs
planar_utils: Used for functions; plot_decision_boundary, sigmoid, load_planar_dataset, load_extra_datasets
